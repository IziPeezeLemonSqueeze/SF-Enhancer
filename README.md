# SF-Enhancer

Developer tool for Salesforce, 
Salesforce Enhancer is a chrome extension designed to help and speed up what the developer has to do!

These are the tools:

<mark>***Shortcut***</mark> -> For quick navigation between commonly used pages, with the ability to add custom shortcuts.

***<mark>Show All Data</mark>*** -> To inspect the records on the page you are looking at, editing and organizing has never been faster or easier!

***<mark>Code Snippet</mark>*** -> Run your saved pieces of code, you no longer need to keep them in the salesforce developer console and each time go to search and select the one you want to use. With a simple organize and execute code interface, you can even edit your runtime code, making it usable in more situations!

***<mark>Object Fast Code</mark>*** -> For all those situations where you always have to operate the same way on a record, you will be able to define the rules and methods in which your record must be modified. It also includes a NOTES section broken down by the type of object you are looking at!

***<mark>Settings</mark>*** -> Setting and displaying the extension setting and ORG and Current User, also includes tutorials for each extension tool!

More will come !

# Security and Privacy

Salesforce Enhancer browser extension/plugin communicates directly between the user's web browser and the Salesforce servers.
No data is sent to other parties and no data is persisted outside of Salesforce servers after the user leaves the Salesforce pages.

Salesforce Enhancer communicates via the official Salesforce webservice APIs on behalf of the currently logged in user.
This means Salesforce Enhancer will be capable of accessing nothing but the data and features the user has been granted access to in Salesforce.

All Salesforce API calls from the Salesforce Enhancer re-uses the access token/session used by the browser to access Salesforce.
To acquire this access token the Salesforce Enhancer requires permission to read browser cookie information for Salesforce domains.

To validate the accuracy of this description, inspect the source code, monitor the network traffic in your browser or take my word.
